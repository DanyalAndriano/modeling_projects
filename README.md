# Modeling Projects

This repository contains notebooks for modeling projects on toy datasets that I did to explore statistical modeling using python.

# Decisions & Hypotheses

Using the Northwind database--a free, open-source dataset created by Microsoft containing data from a fictional company, I wanted to use statistical modeling to try and answer specific questions about whether or not the company should be giving discounts on their products, which products to discount (in which region) and if so - how much discount?

These questions were quite challenging to answer due to limited data -- however, this perhaps made the task of having to decide on what actions to take realistic for some companies.
